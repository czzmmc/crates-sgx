This crate implements a half-precision floating point `f16` type for Rust implementing the IEEE 754-2008 `binary16` type.

## How-to Use

The `f16` type provides all the same operations as a normal Rust float type, but since it is primarily leveraged for
minimal floating point storage and no major hardware implements them, all math operations are done as an `f32` type.
`f16` by default provides `no_std` support so can easily be used in embedded code where a smaller float is most useful.

*Requries Rust 1.10 or greater.*

See the [crate documentation](https://docs.rs/half/) for more details.

### Optional Features

- **`serde`** - Implement `Serialize` and `Deserialize` traits for `f16`. This adds a dependency on the `serde`
crate. *Requires Rust >= 1.15.*

- **`use-intrinsics`** - Use hardware intrinsics for `f16` conversions if available on the compiler host target. By
default, without this feature, conversions are done only in software, which will be the fallback if the host target does
not have hardware support. **Available only on Rust nightly channel.**

- **`std`** - Use Rust `std` library. This enables the `vec` module, which contains zero-copy conversions for the `Vec`
type. This allows fast conversion between raw `Vec<u16>` bits and `Vec<f16>` arrays, and vice versa.
